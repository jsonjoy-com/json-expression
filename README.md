# JSON Expression

[JSON Expression](https://jsonjoy.com/specs/json-expression) is an s-expression based language for JSON. It is designed to
be a more human-readable and writable alternative to JSON. It uses JSON as its
data model and syntax.

JSON Expressions are JIT compiled to efficient machine code.

Example `1 + 2` JSON Expression:

```json
["+", 1, 2]
```
